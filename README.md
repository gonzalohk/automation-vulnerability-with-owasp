## Automation Vulnerability testing with OWASP ZAP
This is a small example to set up an automation vulnerability test environtment with Java, Gradle, JUnit, OWASP ZAP 2.9.0, and allure for reports.
### WebPage to test
* [https://todoist.com/](https://todoist.com/)
### Tests
* Login (Recorded flow)
* Scan vulnerabilities
### Run
In order to execute test, we have to run OWASP ZAP and set up the local proxy port.
After that, we are able to execute tests with the following command. 
```sh
gradle clean test -i
```
Finally, we generate allure reports using recorder tests data. 
```sh
allure serve build/allure-results
```
